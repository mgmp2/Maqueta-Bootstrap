          <p>This is Neat did a great job during our end of lease move, our apartment was spotless. The service was easy to book and they were very accommodating with our strict deadlines and apartment regulations. The staff were friendly and the service was great. I would highly recommend them for any end of lease moves and would definitely use them again!

          <p>Upon seeing the finished result, I was truly blown away by the meticulous nature in which they had transformed the apartment from the mess of moving out, to the exact 'ready to rent again' level of clean that I needed. I will definitely be using their services again, and am proud to recommend their company to anyone who wants the highest level of professional cleaning at a fantastic rate.

          <p>This is Neat did an excellent job for our 3 bedroom apartment in Chippendale. The clean was very thorough. We had a few issues getting into the car park in our building and I'd like to thank the team for being very patient about this inconvenience. I would definitely use them again next time I move rental properties.
